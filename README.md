# Azure-End-To-End-Project-For-Formula1-Racing-Analysis
A complete azure end-to-end project for analyzing formula1 racing from 1950-2021

## Project Overview:
---
This project aims to develop a comprehensive data engineering pipeline for analyzing Formula 1 race results using Azure Databricks and Azure Data Factory. The pipeline is designed to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, sourcing data from ergast.com, a platform dedicated to Formula 1 statistics. It enables incremental data loads and stores the processed data in Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage. Azure Databricks handles data transformation and advanced analytics, while Azure Data Factory orchestrates the entire workflow. Finally, the fully processed data is utilized to create an insightful Power BI dashboard for visual analysis.
